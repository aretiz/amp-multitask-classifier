# Multitask Classification of Antimicrobial Peptides for Simultaneous Assessment of Antimicrobial Property and Structural Fold

## Introduction
This repository houses an innovative multitask classifier designed to recognize Antimicrobial Peptides (AMPs) and predict their alpha-helical folds simultaneously. AMPs play a crucial role in the innate immune system and have significant potential in drug design and cancer treatment research. The three-dimensional structure of peptides, particularly alpha-helical structures, influences their ability to disrupt cell membranes effectively.

## Key Features
- Multitask classification: Simultaneously identifies AMPs and predicts their alpha-helical folds.
- Efficient representation: Utilizes k-mers and Transformer networks for accurate and efficient classification.
- Reduced complexity: Achieves comparable performance to single-task methods in half the time and complexity.
- Dataset compatibility: Demonstrates stable performance across datasets, showcasing reliability for real-world applications.

## Usage
1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/aretiz/amp-multitask-classifier.git`
2. Navigate to the `code/src/` directory.
3. Run the main script: `python main.py`
