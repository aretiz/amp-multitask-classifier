## Introduction
This repository houses an innovative multitask classifier designed to recognize Antimicrobial Peptides (AMPs) and predict their alpha-helical folds simultaneously. 

## Key Features
- Multitask classification: Simultaneously identifies AMPs and predicts their alpha-helical folds.
- Efficient representation: Utilizes k-mers and Transformer networks for accurate and efficient classification.
- Reduced complexity: Achieves comparable performance to single-task methods in half the time and complexity.
- Dataset compatibility: Demonstrates stable performance across datasets, showcasing reliability for real-world applications.

## Usage
1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/aretiz/amp-multitask-classifier.git`
2. Navigate to the `code/src/` directory.
3. Run the main script: `python multitask.py` or `python singletask.py`
